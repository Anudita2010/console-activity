            <p> So, what is console? Well, lets make this simple. Its like this secret place where you can write stuff for other
                people to see! Cool right? So, I am using console on the project. I bet you guys wanna see whats written in my console
            right? So anyway, right click on your computer screen, go to inspect and then the second tab! 
        Done!! So easy? So, how do I right stuff on the console? you can either create main.jss or put the script tag!
    enter console.log("Enter text here") I feel its super easy, I hope you feel that way too!! ðŸ¤— </p>

                console.log("This is the console screen");
        var first_name="Anandita";
        var last_name="Shetty";
        var full_name=first_name.concat(last_name);
        console.log(full_name)
        var a = 12;
        var b = 24;
        var add = a + b;
        console.log(add);
        var c = 38;
        var d = 13;
        var subtract = c - d;
        console.log(subtract);
        var e = 23;
        var f = 34;
        var multiply = e * f;
        console.log(multiply);
        var g = 69;
        var h = 23;
        var divide = g / h;
        console.log(divide);
